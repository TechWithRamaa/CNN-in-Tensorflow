# CNN in TensorFlow

Welcome to the **CNN in TensorFlow** project! This repository contains a series of Jupyter notebooks that explore various techniques for building and optimizing Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet) models tailored for image classification tasks. 

## Overview

This collection of notebooks focuses on:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Techniques to prepare and clean image data for training.
- **Model Building**: Constructing ConvNet architectures for different classification problems.
- **Augmentation Techniques**: Enhancing the training dataset through various augmentation methods to improve model robustness.
- **Transfer Learning**: Utilizing pre-trained models to boost performance on new tasks.
- **Multi-Class Classification**: Approaches to handle classification tasks involving more than two categories.
